                                Basic example
                                Basic is used on calculators and is especially good at calculating and solving math equations. The company Casio for example has produced a number of calculators or ‚ÄòBASIC pocket computers‚Äô that are programmable with BASIC. Users can create their own programs, edit them and execute them on demand.
                                An example from the user's manual of the ‚ÄòCasio FX-880P‚Äô is this program which calculates the volume of a cylinder (Personal, n.d., p.46):<br><br>
                                <code>
                                10 REM CYLINDER<br>
                                20 R = 15<br>
                                30 INPUT ¬®H = ¬® ; H<br>
                                40 V = PI * R^ 2 * H  (PI indicates ùúã )<br>
                                50 PRINT ¬®V = ¬® ; V<br>
                                END<br>
                                </code>

                                Python example
                                Python is a very general purpose language and can be used for almost anything. I found this fun short movie that explains it quite well: What is Python used for (Love, 2014).
                                An example of where Python might be fast and easy to use is to count or add something. For example 
                                Python has a build in counter class that is fairly easy to use to count most common words for example (Python, n.d.):<br><br>
                                <code>
                                # Find the ten most common words in Hamlet<br>
                                import re<br>
                                words = re.findall(r'\w+', open('hamlet.txt').read().lower())<br>
                                Counter(words).most_common(10)<br><br>
                                    
                                [('the', 1143), ('and', 966), ('to', 762), ('of', 669), ('i', 631),<br>
                                 ('you', 554),  ('a', 546), ('my', 514), ('hamlet', 471), ('in', 451)]<br>
                                </code>
                                
                                    <div class="table-title">
                                    <h3>Data Table</h3>
                                    </div>

                                    Basics compiled code has to be be translated into binary/assembly language before the program is executed (stakx, 2010). </td>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Interpreted</strong><br>

                                    Python does not need compilation to binary because you can run the program directly from the source code/from the command line (Features, n.d.).</td>

                                    <tr>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Compiler</strong><br>

                                    This requires a lot of expertise and you have to make sure the proper libraries are linked and loaded etc. for the program to run without error (Features, n.d.).

                                    To do this you have to use a compiler, which is a special program you need to download and install first and then run your program through.</td>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Virtual machine/ Interpreter</strong><br>

                                    Python does have a compiler, but it runs automatically. 
                                    The Python compiler is a virtual machine (which itself is a compiled program, for example: CPython) that converts the code into an intermediate form called bytecodes. (Understanding, 2014). 
                                    Running the program afterwards is done through an interpreter which takes the bytecodes and translates them into the native language of your computer, which then can run the program (DeSimone, 2012).
                                    The Python interpreter is installed as a program when you first install Python on it./td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Initial waiting time</strong><br>

                                    Compiling can take anywhere from a few seconds to hours of waiting before the program is ‚Äòdone‚Äô.

                                    After the code is compiled, it needs to be tested. This can also take some effort and time.</td>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>No initial waiting time</strong><br>

                                    There is no delay when using Python and it is perfect for being used on demand.

                                    Testing python is done while you write it and errors can often be dealt with ‚Äòon the go‚Äô.</td>

                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>High effort when porting</strong><br>
                                    All this makes BASIC code very specific to one computer or system, since implementation of the same code into other systems often requires you to make a lot changes to the source code or recompiling it. Also paths and libraries might be moved or not available and functions might differ in behavior on the new system (stakx, 2010).</td>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Easily Portable</strong><br>

                                    Python code is easily portable to any other computer. 
                                    There are several good tools available to work on your python code anywhere:</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Fast execution speed</strong><br>
                                    The finished programs are executed directly by the CPU, which makes them startup fast and react to commands almost instantaneous (Grant, 2014).
                                    This often means that compiled languages are faster than interpreted, but speed varies with each program/system.</td>
                                    <td class="text-left"><strong>Slow execution speed</strong><br>

                                    Because of the way Python is first compiled by a virtual machine and then interpreted by another program before it actually executes the program, it is often times slower than a compiled program that can execute without delay.</td>
