                            <h1 style="text-align:center; color:#4c0075;">What is a Dynamic array - In Java</h1>
                            <h5 style="color:#4c0075;">31. July 2016  written by Christina Bögh</h5>  
                                
                                A dynamic array is an array that is able to handle continuous change - this means you can be
                                adding and removing items from the array at any time.<br>
                                <br>
                                ArrayList<br>
                                This type of data structure is an object ( normal arrays are as well) and are in Java called

                                ArrayList.

                                ArrayList makes a list of items and it can hold any element, even null. All the elements in the

                                dynamic array have to be of the same type ( int or String etc.).

                                The ArrayList has something called capacity, which is the size of the array and the capacity

                                increases with the size of items in the array. (&quot;ArrayList (Java Platform SE 7 ),&quot; n.d.).

                                The ArrayList is an object the class  java.util library and is implemented as standard in

                                Java.

                                You import it by writing: import java.util.ArrayList; at the top of your code.

                                (&quot;Home and Learn - Array Lists in Java,&quot; n.d.).

                                ArrayList has methods for inserting, deleting and searching.<br><br>
    
                                    Vector.<br>

                                Java has a class called Vector, which is basically the same as the ArrayList, but synchronized.

                                Synchronization is important when several threads try to access and update the array at the

                                same time. However, it seems to be the general rule to avoid using Vector and instead use

                                ArrayList with an added synchronization when needed.

                                (Tran, 2016).<br>
                                    In my example, below I implemented such a synchronization by using a method

                                (.synchronizedList) from the

                                import java.util.Collections;

                                List&lt;String&gt; syncList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;());

                                (Swartz, 2006).

                                (Pjhanzlik, 2016).<br><br>

                                Creation:<br>

                                When you want to create a new array or ArrayList object of for example type integer this is

                                how you do it and how they are different:<br>
    
                                
                                Normal array: <br>
                                <code>Integer[] ints = new Integer[x]</code>
                                <br>
                                ArrayList: <br>
                                <code>List&lt;Integer&gt; ints = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();</code>

                                <br>

                                The ArrayList does not need to be initialized with a size like this array is with x.

                                (Swartz, 2006).<br><br>
    
                                        Iteration<br>

                                    To go through each item in your ArrayList you can set up something called an Iterator.

                                    It is a class also found in the standard library.

                                    import java.util.Iterator;<br><br>

                                    Example:<br>

                                    Create the ArrayList object called syncList like shown below:
<br><br>
                                    <code>
                                        public static void main(String[] args) {<br>

                                    List&lt;String&gt; syncList =new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
                                    

                                    // Adding elements to the ArrayList with the .add method.<br>

                                    
                                 syncList.add(&quot;one&quot;);<br>

                                    syncList.add(&quot;two&quot;);<br>

                                    syncList.add(&quot;three&quot;);<br><br>

                                    // when iterating over a synchronized list, we need to synchronize access to the synchronized

                                    list.<br>

                                    synchronized (syncList) {<br>

                                    // new Iterator object called iterator. can be used to go through the items in the ArrayList with

                                    the method .next.

                                    Iterator&lt;String&gt; iterator = syncList.iterator(); <br> 

                                    //while loop to iterate through the list.<br>

                                    while (iterator.hasNext()) {<br>

                                    System.out.println(&quot;item: &quot; + iterator.next());<br>

                                    }<br>

                                    //searching the array with the .contains method.<br>

                                                   System.out.println (syncList.contains(&quot;two&quot;)); }<br>

                                    }<br>

                                    }</code>
    <br><br>

                                    Output:<br>

                                    run:<br>

                                    item: one<br>

                                    item: two<br>

                                    item: three<br>

                                    true<br>

                                    BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 0 seconds)<br>

                                    (Eriksson, n.d.).<br>

                                    As you can see from the output that three Strings were in the ArrayList (“One”, “two”,

                                    “three”) and the iterator found and printed them one after the other.

                                    The last method (.contains) found that it is indeed true that the String ”two” can be found in

                                    the ArrayList, and thus prints true.

                                    When to use a dynamic array over a regular array

                                    Advantage:

                                    If you do not know how many items you want your array to hold, using an ArrayList is probably

                                    the best idea, since you can add and remove items to it.

                                    Disadvantage:

                                    Normal arrays are faster, take a fixed amount of memory and you can make a normal array

                                    double- and multi-dimensional, whereas an ArrayList is only one-dimensional.
