        <p>
           <br />
Inspiring others, helping them find their purpose or meaning, being a different kind of leader from what's traditional-that's 
		really gratifying. I just do that naturally. The challenge is opening up people's minds to have their own original 
		thoughts. I'm a listener and guide.
<br />
I think I am a mystery to people. They never really understand me and part of me enjoys that. More often though, I 
		long to be understood.
<br />
I tend to approach my day with a structured way of getting things accomplished. People see me as organized, thorough, 
		and easy to get along with, pulling my own weight and eager to help out when called upon. But I'm not 
		as outgoing or as critical as I may sometimes appear. I need a balance between people contact and working 
		on creative projects and will break away from interactions when I get tired out. If I don't have some long-term goals,
		then what's the point?
<br />
I tend to intuitively read people very quickly, but I have to be cautious not to make assumptions. I'm an observer. 
		I get a feeling when people are interesting, and I watch from a distance, make some assessments about the 
		situation, and then approach them and engage in conversation. I put a little bit out and a little more and 
		see how that goes. Do I trust and like them, are they who they say? I have a few deep friendships. A friendship 
		comes best when it is worked to develop that investment. I quickly pick up on sincerity and withdraw if the
		person is superficial or obviously doesn't care. When I see people who abuse their power or won't stand 
		behind what they say, that ticks me off. It's about integrity. I feel other people's feelings, and taking
		on that burden can make me too intense and serious, where I can't be spontaneous and fun loving...
<br />
Everything revolves around growth. Caring is about the ability to help others grow. What I bring is caring about people, 
		not things. If we spent more time trying to understand each other's point of view, to communicate more 
		effectively, we would grow. In an honest, open, sincere relationship, I can accomplish anything. My 
		challenge is to create those kinds of relationships. I respect most the person who is willing to come
		forth and be an individual-to make the world a better place, or make a difference in a person's life, 
		where we reach each other's hearts.
